    <li><p>HTML is like a special language that computers use to create web pages. It's like building blocks that help put things together on the internet.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML is really simple. It uses special words called "tags" to tell the computer how to show things on a web page. For example, there's a tag called h1 for making big headings and another tag called p for making paragraphs.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML is lightweight, which means it doesn't take up a lot of space. That's why web pages load quickly and we don't have to wait too long to see them.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML has grown and gotten better over time. The latest version is called HTML5, and it has cool new features. It can show videos, play music, and draw pictures directly on the web page.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML works together with another language called CSS. CSS helps make web pages look pretty by adding colors, fonts, and layouts. It's like the magic that makes web pages beautiful.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML has special words called "semantic tags" that help tell the computer what different parts of a web page mean. For example, there are tags for the header, navigation menu, main content, and footer. This makes it easier for everyone, including people with disabilities and search engines, to understand the web page better.</p></li>
    <li><p>HTML is smart and can adapt to different devices like phones and tablets. This means that web pages can look good on any screen, no matter how big or small it is. HTML knows how to rearrange things so that they fit nicely on different devices.</p></li>
